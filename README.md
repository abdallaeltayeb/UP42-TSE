# UP42-TSE
UP42 Technical support engineer review 
Deforestation Monitoring from the space:
This Jupyter notebook provides an overview of a workflow/pipeline that utilises UP42 resources to provide a detailed picture of deforestation monitoring an the Amazon. The pipeline uses UP42 API and Python SDK to retrieve Sentinel 2 imageries over a certain area of interest and then applies a vegetation index (NDVI) over a certain time slot in the form of time series. P.S.: this notebook is for demo purposes. It uses UP42 documentation as the main source.
